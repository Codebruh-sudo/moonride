# MONRIDE (Contact Deduplication API)

This is a small project I made to handle contact information (email and phone numbers).  
It checks if a contact already exists and groups related ones together using a primary and secondary contact system.

---

## ðŸ”§ What this does

- You send an email or phone number (or both)
- If the contact is new, it creates it
- If it matches an existing one, it links them
- It returns back all related emails and phone numbers under one main contact.
